# Nixie tube clock with WiFi

This is a Nixie tube clock with IN-12 (axial view) Nixie tubes.
For nice packaging, the design is split into two boards. They
mount [at right angles](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11yNopbXGtAtQ4xKlA-b-B579JGvuL5Y8hJCB-doAy8I/edit?usp=sharing) using 96-pin Eurobus ("VME") connectors.
